# Scrapy-IMDB-Movies

The explanation of the code step-by-step


1. Importing Scrapy:
```
import scrapy
```
- This line imports the Scrapy library, which is used for web scraping.

2. Class Definition:
```
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
```
- This line defines a class named `ImdbSpider` that inherits from the `scrapy.Spider` class. It serves as the spider's blueprint.

3. Spider Name:
```
    name = "imdb"
```
- This line sets the name of the spider as "imdb".

4. Start URLs:
```
    start_urls = ["https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"]
```
- This line specifies the starting URL(s) for the spider. In this case, it starts from the IMDb Top 250 movies chart.

5. Parse Method:
```
    def parse(self, response):
```
- This line defines the `parse` method, which is a callback function invoked by Scrapy to handle the response from each URL.

6. CSS Selector:
```
        for movies in response.css('.titleColumn'):
```
- This line iterates over the elements with the class "titleColumn" in the response. It represents movie information on the page.

7. Yielding Data:
```
            yield {
                'title': movies.css('.titleColumn a::text').get(),
                'year': movies.css('.secondaryInfo::text').get(),
                'rate': response.css('strong::text').get()
            }
```
- This block of code creates a dictionary for each movie found, with keys 'title', 'year', and 'rate'. The corresponding values are extracted using CSS selectors.

8. Pass Statement:
```
        pass
```
- This line is a placeholder and does nothing. It indicates the end of the `parse` method.

By combining these lines of code, you define a Scrapy spider named "imdb" that starts at the IMDb Top 250 movies chart. It extracts movie information, such as titles, release years, and ratings, from the web page using CSS selectors. The extracted data is then yielded in the form of dictionaries.
