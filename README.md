The explanation of the code

```
import scrapy

class GamesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "games"
    start_urls = ["https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame"]
```

The code begins by importing the `scrapy` module, which is a Python framework used for web scraping. 
It then defines a class called `GamesSpider` that inherits from `scrapy.Spider`. 
The spider is given a name "games" and a start URL, which is set to "https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame".

```
    def parse(self, response):
```

Inside the `GamesSpider` class, there's a method called `parse`. 
This method is automatically called by Scrapy when a response is received from the start URL or any subsequent requests made.

```
        for game in response.css('#row_'):
            yield {
                'rank': game.css('.collection_rank a::attr(name)').get(),
                'name': game.css('.primary ::text').get(),
                'rate': game.css('#row_ .collection_bggrating:nth-child(5) ::text').get().split()[0]
            }
```

Within the `parse` method, a loop is used to iterate over each game element selected by the CSS selector `#row_` in the response. 
For each game, the spider extracts information such as the rank, name, and rating. 
These details are stored as key-value pairs in a dictionary, which is then yielded to be processed later.

```
        next_page = response.xpath('//*[@id="maincontent"]/form/div/div[1]/a[5]').attrib['href']
        if next_page is not None:
            yield  response.follow(next_page, callback=self.parse)
```

After extracting game information, the code looks for a next page URL using an XPath selector. 
If a next page exists, it is extracted and stored in the `next_page` variable. 
The code then checks if `next_page` is not `None`. 
If a next page URL is found, the spider uses `response.follow` to create a new request to that URL, and the `parse` method 
is recursively called again to continue parsing the subsequent page.

That's a brief explanation of the code. It uses Scrapy to scrape game information from the BoardGameGeek website, 
starting from the provided URL and following pagination to collect data from multiple pages.
